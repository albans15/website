**Lab 3**

For this lab, I utilized W3Schools and Stackoverflow for the majority of my code. 

-I also worked with my group on *part 1*, using some of the solution posted to LMS. 

-For *part 2* I utilized stackoverflow for guidance and examples. The javasript is there, however it doesn't seem to work with the html document..

-I wasn't able to get *part 3* for this lab. I plan to review the powerpoint from last thursdays class and practice some javascript so I can get both part 2 and 3 to work..

For the purpose of the submission, I figured this was better (hopefully some partial credit) than nothing. I do recognize that the submission is also late, so I understand points needing to be deducted for that as well. I hope to make it to the office hours this Friday, if the class I have during that time gets out early.
