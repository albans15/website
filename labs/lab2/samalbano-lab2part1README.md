**LAB 2 - PART 1**

For this part, I used divs to display a table of my 6 favorite songs. The following link - http://www.dummies.com/web-design-development/css3/using-the-div-tag-to-create-tables/ - is where I got help with displaying my divs properly and in table format. I added my own CSS to the HTML, which I think makes the table more visually appealing.

All markup has been validated as XHTML 1.0 Strict and all HTML is semantically correct. Semantic elements were applied to the non-semantic element "div" through the use of CSS.

**LAB 2 - PART 2**

I referenced w3schools - http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_xlink.asp - for XML guides and suggestions, particularly with using the XLINK feature. I chose to use descriptive elements rather than attributes in my markup, keeping the overall structure similar to how a typical playlist is set up. I chose elements because they can contain multiple values and work well in the document tree structure. All markup has been validated as well-formed XML.

**LAB 2 - PART 3**

In this part, you will find that both my CSS and HTML have been adjusted to reflect the requirements for part 3 (comments have been added indicating what markup has been added and why) (CSS is now referenced externally.) I found the following link - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3200249/html-list-style-type-dash - to help with adding the dashes to the list elements in the genre section. All markup has been validated as XHTML 1.0 Strict.

**LAB 2 - PART 4**

For this part of the lab, I experience trouble with getting the html namespace provided in the lab instructions to work. I found the following - <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> - at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22522290/trying-to-display-a-picture-in-xml, which allowed my pictures and links to work. I utilized resources from w3schools to assist with styling the XML using CSS. (I mainly ran into trouble with spacing on a given line and lining the columns up). I made some changes to my XML file so that the CSS would be able to work properly with it. All markup has been validated as well-formed XML.
