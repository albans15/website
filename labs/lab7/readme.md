**Lab 7 - Sam Albano - 11/14/2016**

> Fixed Quiz 1 first

I set up my directory in the correct format with the proper folders. I then had to fix my AJAX GET request to properly output the XML data to my HTML file. I used http://www.w3schools.com/xml/tryit.asp?filename=try_dom_loadxmldoc for help with fixing my JavaScript file. You will see that I display the output in the HTML using an onclick function, which helps separate the labs from the homework (and also sets me up for when I improve my design/layout for this lab). I also chose to get each element individually by it's tag name...I understand there is an easier way to do this (defining var x, i, and setting i=0 i<x.length i++) which uses significantly less code. I chose to do it a different way because in terms of editing the document, it is much easier to see what I'm editing and it is much easier to delete a homework or lab if need be (kind of like what you told me about using the array in the lab 4 XML doc for the genres).

> Part 1

I created my remote repo named 'website' using the GitBash command prompt from my directory. You will see that I have a branch named 'master' that holds all of my code, including the readme.md that displays on my repo's main page. I also initialized a local branch named 'tracking' to track my remote branch 'master'. The repo is public, so I did not need to invite you or Professor Plotka.
