**Lab 8 - Samantha Albano - 11/9/2016**

Comments: For this lab, I have all of my commands from Part 2 in the 'input #1-10.txt' file, all of the output from those commands in the 'output #1-10.xls' file, and the overall structure/content of the database in the 'Database websyslab8.docx' file. 

Observations: I enjoyed working with MySQL and phpmyadmin again, especially since I used SQL over the summer working at my internship. I used it to query existing tables of a database, so it was cool being able to go through the process of making my own tables for this lab. It was a nice refresher too since I will probably be using SQL again when I go back to the internship over winter break.
