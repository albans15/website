**Lab 9 - Samantha Albano - 11/16/2016**

For this lab, I used stackoverflow and W3Schools for help with the PDO and prepared statements.

For part 2 (choices 1 and 2) the database, tables, and values once created/inserted, display a message to the user.

For part 2 (choices 3 and 4), I had trouble with calling part of the output.php file. So rather than use the one program I split it into two, and called two separate output.php files:

Choice 3 - output.php

Choice 4 - output2.php

-For part 2 choice 4, I also had issues with the count function. It still groups the grades by the ranges, but lists them underneath the ranges rather than just showing the count.

My insert.php file is where you will find my prepared statements. Var_dump was not used, as instructed. 

I tried adding some aesthetic appeal, but wanted to keep it simple. Each option calls the correct php file as instructed.
