**Sam Albano - Lab 4 - 10/19/2016**

Part 1
 
>For part 1, I structured my JSON file similar to how I structured my XML file for lab 2. I used the same labels and ensured my format was valid by using the JSON Lint tool, as instructed in the directions.

Part 2

>For part 2, I used the image.click function and AJAX GET request to access my JSON file. At first I had everything populate in #site, however after rereading the instructions, I creating individual GET requests to output the results to the appropriate HTML property. I recognize there might have been an alternative way to doing this, one that would require less repetitiveness and thus be more efficient. However, this way seemed to work, and everything has been validated. I did try something different with my links - I tried making it so by clicking on the album cover, you are directed to the AllMusic link...but it just gives an Error 404 Page Not Found...I spent a lot of time playing with it, but I still can seem to figure it out.

>You will also see with my HTML that my images are displayed underneath the rest of the text. I tried getting them to display inline with the rest of the text. I also made it so before clicking on the image, you get an idea as to how the table will load with heading listed. Then once the image is clicked, the heading is replaced with the actual content. I am aware that it doesn't absolutely match my Lab 2 output, however the same CSS, as far as fonts, styles, and borders, were applied. Though it doesn't match exactly, it still is readable and makes sense. (Also added alt tag to #coverart image as there was not one there before)
