**Assignment 1 - The Resume**

1. All markup was validated as XHTML 1.0 Strict. I chose to use this doc type because I am familiar with it and and the different elements/attributes that it allows.

2. This doctype compares to that of HTML 4.01 Strict in that they both contain all HTML elements and attributes, but do not include presentational or deprecated elements. Neither of these doctypes allow framesets (utilized W3 Schools to gather information for this comparison). In my markup, you will find that I used both divs and spans (more divs). For styling purposes, divs were useful in adding semantic elements to through the use of CSS. If I used divs in one section, I did so in the other to keep things consistent. For my markup, I followed a similar pattern to that of my lab 2 (the Playlist).

3. The hcard information added to the contact information is useful to both humans and automated user agents by offering more structure. They also prove easier for styling with CSS and allow applications to retrieve information directly from web pages without having to reference a separate file (utilized the following to learn about hcard microformats: http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard#Property_List).
