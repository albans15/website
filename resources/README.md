**Websys Quiz 1 - October 11, 2016**

Part 1: I already had my directory with my lab folders set up and a virtual host for my websys directory created. I added the two homework folders and resources folder, which includes all of my config files and this readme.md file.

Part 2: I created my XML file, which lists all of my labs and homeworks, with the associated descriptions and locations. I then created the AJAX GET request, which when loaded, should output the XML file to my index.html file. However, I wrote an error function, which is all that I got to work. You can see the error message when you open the index.html file in the browser.

As for as styling goes, I kept my style simple and easy to read. I put my labs and homeworks side-by-side, and added a title for the web page. I tried styling it so it was similar to a projects page I made last year in Intro, so used the same colors and some of the same fonts.
